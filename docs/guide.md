## Project Structure

A typical Termynth project created with `CreateProject.exe` looks like this:
```text
MyProject/
│
├── Engine/             # (optional) engine submodule
├── Source/
│   ├── Public/         # public headers
│   └── Private/        # source files
├── Scripts/            # build scripts (optional)
└── CMakeLists.txt      # cmake build configuration
```
## Quick Start
Here’s a minimal example to get started with Termynth:

```cpp
"placeholder"
```
- This initializes the engine and renders a simple message to the console.
- Save it as main.cpp in your project, then build using your preferred method (CMake or provided scripts).


## Building and Running
- Use the batch scripts from `Scripts/` for convenience.
- Or run CMake manually to configure and build your projects.
