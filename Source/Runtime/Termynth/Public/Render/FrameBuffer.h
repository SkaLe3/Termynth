 * @brief Represents a generic framebuffer.

 * It simply manages a single buffer of the specified width and height.
 * 
 * Always use GenHandle() function to get correct data handle of the CurrentBuffer, 
 * sice Handle variable may contain PreviousBuffer address if isntance runtime type is NativeWindowFrameBuffer

/**
 * @brief Framebuffer specialized for use with windows.
 *
 * This class supports double buffering for window to optimize window redraws.
 * Only cells that have changed between frames are updated, improving performance.
 *
 * NativeWindowFrameBuffer maintains two FrameBuffer instances:
 * - CurrentBuffer: stores the current frame being drawn.
 * - PreviousBuffer: stores the last frame that was displayed.
 *
 * AllocatedMemory is used internally to hold the actual cell data and stores correct address to delete in the destructor,
 * since CurrentBuffer and PreviousBuffer constantly swap addresses
 *
 * Use this class when rendering to a window or interactive display where minimizing redraws is important.
 * For offscreen rendering or non-interactive buffers, the base FrameBuffer class is sufficient,
 * and double buffering is unnecessary.
